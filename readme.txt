== Installation ==
When not installing from the Wordpress plugin directory, unzip the archive and upload the files to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Special notice to the directory name. You probably noticed it is called 'zproductlisters'.
This is not a mistake. This plugin needs to be loaded after the e-commerce plugins otherwise certain required classed will not be loaded.
This way our plugin is loaded after the last supported e-commerce plugin.

If you have some sort obscure directory hierarchy for your plugins you may run into the the error that no suitable e-commerce was found whilest you do use it.
In that case you can hack the productlisters.php constructor and fill `$this->current_plugin` hardcoded with your plugin name.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

When all works out well you find a fresh productlisters.xml in your wp-content directory.
The url to this file can be used as the feed url in your ProductListers account.
Or send to anywhere else if you like of course.
